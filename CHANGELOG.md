## <a name="0_2_3"></a>[0.2.3] ― Fix for #1 ― Fix timed transition for slides

## <a name="0_2_2"></a>[0.2.2] ― Added support for MMM-KeyBindings Instances

- Added support for using MMM-KeyBindings control with multiple instances of the MagicMirror² open. For example, you can use a remote on the screen attached to the Raspberry Pi (SERVER) and use a keyboard on another computer with the mirror running in a browswer (LOCAL) to independently change slides on the respective screens.

## <a name="0_2_1"></a>[0.2.1] ― Multiple instances of a module

Changes:

- Added the ability to handle mutiple instances of a module. To use, add a `carouselId: "uniqueString"` to each modules' `config` section:

```javascript
        {
            module: "clock",
            position: "top_left",
            config: {
                carouselId: "1",
                displayType: "both"
            }
        },
        {
            module: "clock",
            position: "top_left",
            config: {
                carouselId: 2,
            }
        },
        {
            module: 'MMM-Carousel',
            position: "bottom_bar",
            config: {
                mode: 'slides',
                slides: [
                    [   {name:'clock', classes:'zoom200', position:"top_left", carouselId: "1"} ],
                    [   {name:'clock', classes:'', position:"top_left", carouselId: 2},  ]]
            }
        },
```

## [0.2.0] ― Added manual-only slides and per-slide positions & classes

Changes:

- Added the ability to pass an object with detail for a module on a per slide basis. Passing a config similar to the following shows a large clock on the first slide and then a small clock and additional modules on the second.

```javascript
    mode: 'slides',
    slides: [
        [   {name:'clock', classes:'zoom200', position:"middle_center"} ],
        [   {name:'clock', classes:'', position:"top_left"},
            {name:'calendar', position:'top_left'},
            'MMM-WunderGround',
            'newsfeed'
        ]
```

- Made use of `zoom` classes introduced in [0.1.1]: using the method above, supported zooms are 070%, 080%, 090%, 125%, 150%, 175%, and 200%. Pass `classes:''` for 100%.
- Added support for indefinite slides -- set `transitionInterval: 0` for manual-transition only slides
- Added KeyPress events to go to specific slide index. (e.g. `Slide0: "Home"` in the KeyBindings would jump to the first slide when the home key is pushed). Works with any number of slides in the format `Slide#: "KeyName"` where # is the 0-based index of the slide.

## [0.1.1] ― Added manual transitions

Changes:

- Added manual transitions between slides
- Added optional Pagination indicators at the bottom of the screen to show what slide is currently showing.
- Added hidden next/previous page controls that show on hover in each lower corner
